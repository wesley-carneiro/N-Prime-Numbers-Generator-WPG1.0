The bmp image has two plotted functions.

x axis: number_of_primes ​​found.
Y axis: time spent in seconds.

In green we have the math function that describes the expected behavior.

In yellow, the behavior of the experiment.

GnuPlot COMMAND:
------------------------------------------------- -----------
set grid
set title "Algorithm tested with: Intel(R) Core(TM) i3-4005U -- FREQUENCY = 1700000 kHz"
set key above
set ylabel 'Time in seconds'
set xlabel 'Number of prime numbers found = x'
log2(x) = log(x)/log(2)

INSTRUCTIONS:
0. DOWNLOAD and Run the program and provide an input N > 1Million (with no other open programs)
1. Open GnuPLot
( Installation on linux: 
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install gnuplot-qt
)
2. Ctrl+C IN COMMAND
3. Ctr+V NO GnuPLot
4. Replace file path with correct path.
5. Enter
6. Go back and change the processor frequency parameter in the COMMAND, according to your machine
7. Test the changed command.
8. Compare your result with mine (file "aproximacao7milhoes.bmp")
9.If your graph doesn't look like mine, it's because there are other parameters to be considered in your processor, or it's "fighting" for the CPU core with other processes, or the CPU isn't operating at the desired frequency.
